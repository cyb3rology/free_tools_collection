<h1>Free OSINT tools collection</h1>

Hey there, OSINT fans! This list is different from the usual startme and OSINT collections you see around. It's all about OSINT tools that are both free and working. I've gone through a bunch of other OSINT lists and got rid of any tools that cost money or just don't work anymore. I know how frustrating it is to find a long list of OSINT tools, only to be let down by broken links and hidden costs. So, with this list, you won't have to waste time clicking on links that lead nowhere or signing up before you even know what you're getting. It's all about saving time and cutting down on useless clicks.

Enjoy and donâ€™t forget to check out my Medium [@cyb3rology](https://medium.com/@cyb3rology) for loads of cool cyber stuff, including OSINT.
